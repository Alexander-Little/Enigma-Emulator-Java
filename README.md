# Enigma-Emulator-Java
The Enigma Machine:A brief history (from wikipedia)
-------------------------------------------------------
The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical 
rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- 
to mid-twentieth century to protect commercial, 
diplomatic and military communication. Enigma was 
invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius 
at the end of World War I.
	Several different Enigma models were produced, 
but the German military models are the most commonly 
recognised. However, Japanese and Italian models have 
been used.
